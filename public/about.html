<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I am Praying Mantis. I am 19 years old and a "budding" engineer. This is my attempt to learn html.</p>

<p>I like reading books and eating good food. I have my earphones plugged in 24*7. I cannot imagine a life without music.</p>

<p>I love all animals. Especially dogs. I have three of my own. They are the cutest little things ever. I like to crochet and tht gives me a lot of freedom
  to make what I want and save a bunch of money. Thank you for reading this. hehe.
